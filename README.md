# Stock-Analysis

Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project:

Performing analysis on stock data using Excel's VBA function to discover trends

### Purpose

The intent of this project is to help our client discover the performance of several green energy stocks based on predetermined key metrics. As well, as to provide our client with a VBA script that will be scalable to run additional stocks.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes

The main analysis we can draw between our relatively low sample size of two years for these green stocks is that they are highly volatile. In year 2017, we can see that almost all our stocks are exhibiting double digit growth, and only one of our stocks is performing negatively. However, for year 2018, we can see that almost all of our stocks are displaying negative growth. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 

One potential challenge our client perceived is uncertainty whether our VBA script could handle additional stocks without slowing down our analysis. By refactoring our code we were able to cut down our analysis time into one quarter of what it was at the beginning. 

## Results

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code

There are several advantages to refactoring code, but in our case the greatest factor was gaining the flexibility to analyze more stocks without being a detriment to our overall analysis time. Refactoring not only makes our code faster to run, but also will improve our code's organization. This will make our code easier to read, and thus allow for ease of future development of our code. However, refactoring has some disdvantages as well. In more complex code it is possible to be unable to successfully refactor code due to the shear amount of lines. In this case, preservation of the code takes precedence over refactoring. 

### Pros and Cons to our Original VBA Script

In our case, it was simple decision to go forward and refactor our script. Our script was not so complex that refactoring would ultimately destroy the functionality of it, but instead would also allow us to gain the potential to run analysis on larger pools of stocks in the future by optimizing our code. 

### Recommendations 

We would recommend that our client include more years of stock data on future analysis in order to gain a better understanding of the yearly performance of these stocks. We would also recommend that our client gain an overall view for the market by benchmarking our green stocks versus indexes.
